\section*{6.1 ETL Process}

\subsection*{Scheme Decisions}

We use a Star Schema with the dimensions Product, Geography and Time.

The Product Dimension includes:
id, article-id, article-name, productgroup-id, productgroup-name, productfamily-id, productfamily-name, productcategory-id, productcategory-name and price.

The Geography Dimension includes:
id, shop-id, shop-name, city-id, city-name, region-id, region-name, country-id, and country-name.

The Time Dimension includes:
id, day, month, year and quarter.
	
The Fact Table consists of the keys of the dimension tables as well as the measures Sold and Revenue.


\subsection*{CSV Transformation}

\begin{itemize}
\item The Date string "01.01.2020" needs to be split up into its parts Day, Month, Year and Quarter.
\item The comma in revenue needs to be replaces by a dot
\item Corrupt data needs to be ignored
\end{itemize}
